Algorithm: 
Programme language independent concept

Programme:
Pragraming language dependent concept

Pseudo code: 
Between algo and programme

###---Space Time complexities---

Compiler evaluates the programme  
Algorithm will not run on a computer  

Average case  

Best case  

Worst case  

Running time is used for algorithm  
```
Ex: Insertion sort
    array: 5 2 4 6 1 3
    For j <- 2 to length of array
        assign key <- array[j]
            i<- j-1
            while >0 and a[i] > key
                 
        array[i+1] <- key

Theta(n)

theta notation to be used when all the values are known

Ohm(n) Best

BigO worst

O(log n)
