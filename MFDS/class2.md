###Order of a matrix
###Determinnant of a matrix
It can be found only for square matrix
Co factor (-1)power (i+j)
minor

It helps to find the parellologram found by the matrix

### Rank of a matrix
We can understand the nature of equations

    Order of the highest non zero minor is the order of a matrix
    
     |  1   2   |
     |  3   4   | Det = 4*1 - 6 = -2 != 0 so Rankis 2

     |  1   2   3   |
     |  1   4   2   |
     |  2   6   5   |
    Find the Rank of this matrix

### Echelon form


###System of equations

Linear and Non linear
Row wise operation is linear and other than linear everything is non linear

Linear  -- Homogeneous --0
        --  Non homoheneous  -- non zero
            Consistent          non consistent
